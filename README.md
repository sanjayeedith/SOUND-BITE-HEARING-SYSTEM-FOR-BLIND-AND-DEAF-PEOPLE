# SOUND-BITE-HEARING-SYSTEM-FOR-BLIND-AND-DEAF-PEOPLE

Speech and text is the main medium for human communication. A person needs vision to access the information in a text. However those who have poor vision can gather information from voice. This project has been built around Arduino Uno board. It is controlling the peripherals like Camera and headset which act as an interface between the system and the user. Optical Character Recognitions (OCR) is implemented in this project to recognize characters which are then read out by the system through a headset. The camera is mounted on spectacles; it captures a full view of the paper into the system. It is ensured that there are good lighting conditions. The content on the paper should be written in English and be of good font size. When all these conditions are met the system takes the photo, processes it and if it recognizes the content written on the paper it will announce on the headset speaker that the content on the paper has been successfully processed. After this it speaks out the content that was converted in to text format in the system from processing the image of the paper. In this way Arduino Based Reader for Blind helps a blind person to read a paper without the help of any human reader or without the help of tactile writing system.
